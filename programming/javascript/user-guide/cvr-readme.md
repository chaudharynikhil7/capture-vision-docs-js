# Dynamsoft Capture Vision Router Module

The Dynamsoft Capture Vision Router module is the cornerstone of the Dynamsoft Capture Vision architecture. To learn more, please refer to [Architecture of Dynamsoft Capture Vision](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/core/architecture/index.html#capture-vision-router).

For ease of use, this package also includes the Dynamsoft License Module.

The major classes in the package are:

- [CaptureVisionRouter Class](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/web/programming/javascript/api-reference/capture-vision-router/capture-vision-router-module.html#capturevisionrouter-class)
- [LicenseManager Class](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/web/programming/javascript/api-reference/license/license-manager.html)

In most cases, to use a functional module based on the Dynamsoft Capture Vision architecture, the following two packages are required too:

- [Dynamsoft Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamsoft-core)
- [Dynamsoft Utility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamsoft-utility)
