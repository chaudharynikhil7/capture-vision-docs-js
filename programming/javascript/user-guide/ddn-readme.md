# Dynamsoft Document Normalizer Module

The Dynamsoft Document Normalizer module extracts structural information from document images, including document boundaries, shadow areas, and text areas. It uses this information to generate normalized document images through processes such as deskewing, shadow removal, and distortion correction.
